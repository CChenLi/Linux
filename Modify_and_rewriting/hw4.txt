Q1.
In side src 

[time ls]			test speed for orginal
real	0m0.101s
user	0m0.005s
sys	0m0.025s
[time ./ls -a -A]	test speed for new patch
real	0m0.008s
user	0m0.004s
sys	0m0.003s

Apparently, new patch make performance better

Q2.
There might be some program either from the old code of my company or code 
from other place that depends on the bug style of ls. In the case, these
program is very likely to fail.

Q3. [python2 ./randline.py /dev/null]
we will get a
IndexError: list index out of range
Because random.choice put input as a sequence and access, when the sequence
is empty, choice raise IndexError

Q4. [python3 ./randline.py /dev/null]
we will get a
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
Python3 no more support tuple exception, which is supported in python2

Q5. [python2 ./shuf.py -r -n 5 -i 1-9]
When running with python2, my scripy throw an
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'choices'
The reason is I utilized random.choices to implement my function,
and this functionality doesn't not exist in python2.
