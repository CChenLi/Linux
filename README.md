# Linux Enviroment Experiment

This project is based on CS35L UCLA. The main purpose of this project is to construct enviroment under Linux 
system, practice working under Linux. The whole project is divided into 10 section. Each section has a specific
topic. Focusing on topic, explore methods finish certain task. There is a lab log for each task.


## Main topics

* Getting to know your system
* SSH setup and use in application
* Shell scripting
* C programming and debugging
* System call programming and debugging
* Dynamic linking
* Basic change management
* Change management speluning and implementation
* Research and development in computing


### Commands and basic scripting

* Unix wildcards, basic regular expressions
* More advanced commands (e.g., [grep](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/grep.html), [find](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/find.html))
* Pipelines and redirection
* Simple shell scripting
* Idea of interpreted languages

### More scripting, VMs, and construction tools

* Basic of [Python](https://python.org/)
* [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html) as a compromise between interpreted and compiled languages
* Building for source

### Cahnge management basics

* Basic of Makefiles
* [diff](https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/) and [patch](https://www.gnu.org/software/patch/)
* retrieving a package to build and install
* Basic version control, e.g.,[Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Security basics

* Threats, including eavesdropping, tampering, forgery, and denial of service
* Authentication, authorization, and accounting
* Chains of trust
* Firewalls, kernels, and sandboxes
* Intrusion detection
* Backups
* Security polices
